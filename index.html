            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! I’m a young professional with a passion for sports and programming, particularly focused on front-end
                development. I love combining creativity with technology to build modern and functional web interfaces.
                While I'm currently specializing in front-end, I’m also exploring full-stack development, aiming to
                become a well-rounded developer.

                I’m an ambitious person, always eager to learn new things and grow professionally. I enjoy challenges
                and constantly strive to improve my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. I also believe in
                the importance of teamwork and understand how vital collaboration is for achieving the best outcomes.
